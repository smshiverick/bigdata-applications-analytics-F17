        Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, and Public Health
        Informatics: Using Data Mining of Social Media to Track
        Epidemics
    abstract: >
        Data mining of internet search queries and social media for
        influenza related keywords has been used to track seasonal
        influenza and correlates highly with official reports of
        `infuenza-like-illness' (ILI). Efforts to monitor epidemics
        using big data analytics can provide early detection that
        supplements existing systems of disease surveillance.  A
        review of the literature shows that data extracted from social
        media has applications for public health
        informatics. Prediction models based on social media work best
        in areas with a high degree of internet access.

        Big Health Data from Wearable Electronic Sensors (WES) and the Treatment
        of Opioid Addiction
    abstract: >
        Wearable electronic sensors (WES) and mobile health applications can be 
        used to collect vital health data to supplement traditional forms of 
        treatment for opioid addiction and may be used to predict risk factors 
        related to overdose death.

       Using Machine Learning Classification of Opioid Addiction for Big Data Health Analytics
   abstract: >
       Classification of opioid addiction can identify important features relevant 
       for predicting drug abuse and overdose death. Machine learning procedures were 
       used on data from a large National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015) 
       to classify individuals for illicit opioid use according to demographic 
       characteristics and mental health attributes (e.g., depression). Classification 
       models of opioid addiction can be extended for big data health analytics to 
       include high-dimensional datasets, data collected over previous years, or 
       expanded to the larger population of patients taking prescription opioid 
       medication. The results seek to raise awareness of risk factors related to 
       opioid addiction among patients and medication prescribers, and help 
       decrease the risk of opioid overdose death.
